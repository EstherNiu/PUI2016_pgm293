# HW2

## Assignment 1
I mostly worked alone but borrowed heavily from the code provided from the scripts uploaded from the classwork.
The script is meant to be run from terminal and has no pre assigned variable for the API key or the Bus line

## Assignment 2
As with assignment 1 I reused the code from class uploads to create this script.

## Assignment 3
Used the code from classwork once again to build out my Jupyter Notebook.
Encountered a few errors which I mentioned in my code.
